    <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the world of code! Last year, millions of learners from our <br>
      community started with HTML. Why? HTML is the skeleton of all web pages.
      It’ <br>s often the first language learned by developers, marketers, and
      designers and is <br>core to front-end development work. If this is your first
      time touching code, we’re <br>excited for what you’re about to create.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what exactly is HTML? HTML provides structure to the content appearing
      on a website, <br>such as <a href="#">images</a>, text, or
      <a href="#">videos.</a> Right-click on any page on the internet, choose
      “Inspect,” <br>and you’ll see HTML in a panel of your screen.
    </p>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
       *A <em>markup</em> language is a computer language that defines the
        structure and presentation of raw text.
      </li>
      <li>
        *In HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML
        <a href="#">elements.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        *HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access
        to other text through <a href="#">links,</a> <br>also known as hyperlinks.You probably clicked on a couple of hyperlinks on your way to this
        Codecademy course.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Learning HTML is the first step in creating websites, but even a bit of
      knowledge can help you <br>inject code snippets into newsletter, blog or
      website templates. As you continue learning, you can <br>layer HTML with CSS
      and JavaScript to create visually compelling and dynamic websites. <br>But for
      now, we’re going to focus on how to add and modify basic content on a
      page, like text, <br>images, and videos. Don’t worry if the websites look ugly
      — we’re just getting started.
